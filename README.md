# pyRSW
A Fast Monotone Rotating Shallow Water model

How fast? As fast as a sustained 2 Gflop/s per core on a 2.5 GHz cpu (or 2048 Gflop/s with 1024 cores).

Bored with Fortran ? this code is for you, it is pure Python.

Monotone? Because what is the point of invoking an adhoc dissipation or a sofisticated sgs theory when a good numerics can do both?

If you liked Fluid2d and Nyles, you'll love pyRSW.
